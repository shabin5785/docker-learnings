- image has the application binaries and dependencies and the meta data about image and how to run them. No need for kernal or drivers, as the host kernal is reused by the containers hence light weight.

- docker images are made up of union file system. docker image history wil show the historical changes to that image.

- every image starts with a blank layer called "scratch". Images can have multiple layers. so layers are jsut metadata change, with no files uploaded. every layers has a unique SHA to identify it uniquely.

- Images are pulled in layers. So when we pull a image that uses the same layer as an existing image, docker uses the image layer from cache. ( provided it has same SHA as required). So now we have two images sharing same layer ( they will be readonly based on union file system concept)
