**Docker Compose**
- configure relation ship between containers or make them work together. We can use it to create our entire setup of the app, including all required containers. 

- It uses a YAML file configuration containing all continers, networks, volumes etc. then user docker-compose-cli to build the entire thing

- yaml file can be used with docker compose to create local setup and from version 1.13 can be used in prod with docker swarm
