# docker-learnings

- Containers are consistent across different devices. It runs the same way fundamentaly in any device. So we dont need to worry about the way software runs in different platforms

- migrating app to container doesnt need any code change. It runs the same way as before, but in containers. 

- mac natively doesnt support docker, same as win10. So a small virtual os needs to be run in these os to run docker in them ( dont use brew for docker in mac). So mac/win are similar to this feature.`

- In docker edge version means beta version. Its supported only for a month, after that a new version is realeased.  Stable is supported for around 4 months, after that a new one is released.s
